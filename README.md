# audrianna

The personal site for Audrianna.

## Instructions

1. Download and install Git. It's a free tool that pushes your code into the repository (amongst other things).
1. Once Git is installed, create a new directory on the laptop. You can call it whatever you want, but I'll assume in these instructions that the directory is called "code".
1. Open a command prompt (the black terminal application that you use to type in commands on the command line).
1. Navigate to the new directory. You can do this by typing in `cd C:\code`.
1. Once you're _in_ the new directory, type this command: `git clone https://github.com/bytebodger/audrianna.git`. That will bring a local copy of the site down to your laptop. It will also create a "link" between the local code and the remote repository.
